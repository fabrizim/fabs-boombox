Fab's Boombox is a javascript library for a music player. It is built on top of [Sound Manager 2 by Scott Schiller](http://www.schillmania.com/) and the [Ext 3.0 Core library](http://extjs.com/products/extcore/).

The library provides a high level API for interacting with common elements including Tracks, Playlists, and Players. It also comes with a neat UI that kind of looks and behaves like the winamp mini bar.

The project started out as a small widget for a client's site. But, as per usual, I went a bit crazy with it while testing out some of the Ext stuff (extdoc, jsbuilder) and creating a somewhat generic build environment for my JS extensions / libraries. It also gave me a chance to get my hands dirty with the Ext Core library and see what I could do without the safety net of all the prepackaged widgets.

[Check out the Documentation](http://extjs.owlwatch.net/boombox/docs/) for a fully functioning example. Also, check the [Examples](http://extjs.owlwatch.net/boombox/examples/) . The [Basic Example](http://extjs.owlwatch.net/boombox/examples/player.php) may contain offensive sounds if you are either A) a good jazz musician or B) hate jazz.

Also - I realize that there is some funky stuff going on with the Stereogum Podcast example in non-Firefox browsers. Maybe someone can figure that out...

Hopefully someone else finds it useful / interesting.

I called it Boombox because that was the vehicle for some of my favorite musical experiences. Portability. Massive Battery Consumption. Cassette Playback. Doesn't get much better than that.
